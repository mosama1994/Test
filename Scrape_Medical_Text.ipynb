              "<h3>Lab tests</h3><ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Tests for anemia or infection.</strong> Your provider may suggest blood tests to check for anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues — or to check for signs of infection from bacteria or viruses.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Stool studies.</strong> You may need to provide a stool sample so that your provider can test for hidden (occult) blood or organisms, such as parasites, in your stool.</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<h3>Endoscopic procedures</h3>\n",
              "\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Colonoscopy.</strong> This exam allows your provider to view your entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a camera at the end. During the procedure, small samples of tissue (biopsy) may be taken for laboratory analysis. A biopsy is the way to make the diagnosis of <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> versus other forms of inflammation.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Flexible sigmoidoscopy.</strong> Your provider uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the rectum and sigmoid, the last portion of your colon. If your colon is severely inflamed, your provider may perform this test instead of a full colonoscopy.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Upper endoscopy.</strong> In this procedure, your provider uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine (duodenum). While it is rare for these areas to be involved with Crohn's disease, this test may be recommended if you are having nausea and vomiting, difficulty eating, or upper abdominal pain.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Capsule endoscopy.</strong> This test is sometimes used to help diagnose Crohn's disease involving your small intestine. You swallow a capsule that has a camera in it. The images are transmitted to a recorder you wear on your belt, after which the capsule exits your body painlessly in your stool. You may still need an endoscopy with a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Capsule endoscopy should not be performed if a bowel obstruction is suspected.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Balloon-assisted enteroscopy.</strong> For this test, a scope is used in conjunction with a device called an overtube. This enables the technician to look further into the small bowel where standard endoscopes don't reach. This technique is useful when a capsule endoscopy shows abnormalities, but the diagnosis is still in question.</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<h3>Imaging procedures</h3><ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>X-ray.</strong> If you have severe symptoms, your provider may use a standard X-ray of your abdominal area to rule out serious complications, such as megacolon or a perforated colon.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Computerized tomography (CT) scan.</strong> You may have a <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> scan — a special X-ray technique that provides more detail than a standard X-ray does. This test looks at the entire bowel as well as at tissues outside the bowel. <abbr title=\"Computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> enterography is a special <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> scan that provides better images of the small bowel. This test has replaced barium X-rays in most medical centers.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</strong> An <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr> scanner uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues. An <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr> is particularly useful for evaluating a fistula around the anal area (pelvic <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr>) or the small intestine (<abbr title=\"magnetic resonance\">MR</abbr> enterography). Unlike <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr>, there is no radiation exposure with <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr>.</li>\n",

              "<h2>Treatment</h2><p>The goal of inflammatory bowel disease treatment is to reduce the inflammation that triggers your signs and symptoms. In the best cases, this may lead not only to symptom relief but also to long-term remission and reduced risks of complications. <abbr title=\"Inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> treatment usually involves either drug therapy or surgery.</p>\n",
              "<h3>Anti-inflammatory drugs</h3><p>Anti-inflammatory drugs are often the first step in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, typically for mild to moderate disease. Anti-inflammatories include aminosalicylates, such as mesalamine (Delzicol, Rowasa, others), balsalazide (Colazal) and olsalazine (Dipentum).</p>\n",
              "<p>Time-limited courses of corticosteroids are also used to induce remission. In addition to being anti-inflammatory, steroids are immunosuppressing. Which medication you take depends on the area of your colon that's affected.</p>\n",
              "<h3>Immune system suppressors</h3><p>These drugs work in a variety of ways to suppress the immune response that releases inflammation-inducing chemicals into the body. When released, these chemicals can damage the lining of the digestive tract.</p>\n",
              "<p>Some examples of immunosuppressant drugs include azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan) and methotrexate (Trexall).</p>\n",
              "<p>More recently, orally delivered agents also known as \"small molecules\" have become available for <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> treatment. These include tofacitinib (Xeljanz), upadacitinib (Rinvoq) and ozanimod (Zeposia).</p>\n",
              "<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued a warning about tofacitinib, stating that preliminary studies show an increased risk of serious heart-related problems and cancer from taking this drug. If you're taking tofacitinib for ulcerative colitis, don't stop taking the medication without first talking with your doctor.</p>\n",
              "<h3>Biologics</h3><p>Biologics are a newer category of therapy in which therapy is directed toward neutralizing proteins in the body that are causing inflammation. Some are administered via intravenous (IV) infusions and others are injections you give yourself. Examples include infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), golimumab (Simponi), certolizumab (Cimzia), vedolizumab (Entyvio), ustekinumab (Stelara), and risankizumab (Skyrizi).</p>\n",
              "<h3>Antibiotics</h3><p>Antibiotics may be used in addition to other medications or when infection is a concern — in cases of perianal Crohn's disease, for example. Frequently prescribed antibiotics include ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and metronidazole (Flagyl).</p>\n",
              "<h3>Other medications and supplements</h3><p>In addition to controlling inflammation, some medications may help relieve your signs and symptoms, but always talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medications. Depending on the severity of your <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr>, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following:</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li>\n",
              "<p><strong>Anti-diarrheal medications.</strong> A fiber supplement — such as psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) — can help relieve mild to moderate diarrhea by adding bulk to your stool. For more severe diarrhea, loperamide (Imodium A-D) may be effective.</p>\n",
              "<p>These medications could be ineffective or detrimental in some people with strictures or certain infections. Please consult your doctor before taking these medications.</p>\n",
              "</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Pain relievers.</strong> For mild pain, your doctor may recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). However, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and diclofenac sodium likely will make your symptoms worse and can make your disease worse as well.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Vitamins and supplements.</strong> If you're not absorbing enough nutrients, your doctor may recommend vitamins and nutritional supplements.</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<h3>Nutritional support</h3><p>When weight loss is severe, your doctor may recommend a special diet given via a feeding tube (enteral nutrition) or nutrients injected into a vein (parenteral nutrition) to treat your <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr>. This can improve your overall nutrition and allow the bowel to rest. Bowel rest can reduce inflammation in the short term.</p>\n",
              "<p>If you have a stenosis or stricture in the bowel, your doctor may recommend a low-residue diet. This will help to minimize the chance that undigested food will get stuck in the narrowed part of the bowel and lead to a blockage.</p>\n",
              "<h3>Surgery</h3><p>If diet and lifestyle changes, drug therapy, or other treatments don't relieve your <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> signs and symptoms, your provider may recommend surgery.</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li>\n",
              "<p><strong>Surgery for ulcerative colitis.</strong> Surgery involves removal of the entire colon and rectum and the production of an internal pouch attached to the anus that allows bowel movements without a bag.</p>\n",
              "<p>In some cases a pouch is not possible. Instead, surgeons create a permanent opening in your abdomen (ileal stoma) through which stool is passed for collection in an attached bag.</p>\n",
              "</li>\n",
              "<li>\n",
              "<p><strong>Surgery for Crohn's disease.</strong> Up to two-thirds of people with Crohn's disease will require at least one surgery in their lifetime. However, surgery does not cure Crohn's disease.</p>\n",
              "<p>During surgery, your surgeon removes a damaged portion of your digestive tract and then reconnects the healthy sections. Surgery may also be used to close fistulas and drain abscesses.</p>\n",
              "<p>The benefits of surgery for Crohn's disease are usually temporary. The disease often recurs, frequently near the reconnected tissue. The best approach is to follow surgery with medication to minimize the risk of recurrence.</p>\n",

              "<h3>Diet</h3><p>There's no firm evidence that what you eat actually causes inflammatory bowel disease. But certain foods and beverages can aggravate your signs and symptoms, especially during a flare-up.</p>\n",
              "<p>It can be helpful to keep a food diary to keep track of what you're eating, as well as how you feel. If you discover that some foods are causing your symptoms to flare, you can try eliminating those foods.</p>\n",

              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Limit dairy products.</strong> Many people with inflammatory bowel disease find that problems such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and gas improve by limiting or eliminating dairy products. You may be lactose intolerant — that is, your body can't digest the milk sugar (lactose) in dairy foods. Using an enzyme product such as Lactaid may help as well.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Eat small meals.</strong> You may find that you feel better eating five or six small meals a day rather than two or three larger ones.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Drink plenty of liquids.</strong> Try to drink plenty of liquids daily. Water is best. Alcohol and beverages that contain caffeine stimulate your intestines and can make diarrhea worse, while carbonated drinks frequently produce gas.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Consider multivitamins.</strong> Because Crohn's disease can interfere with your ability to absorb nutrients and because your diet may be limited, multivitamin and mineral supplements are often helpful. Check with your doctor before taking any vitamins or supplements.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Talk to a dietitian.</strong> If you begin to lose weight or your diet has become very limited, talk to a registered dietitian.</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<h3>Smoking</h3><p>Smoking increases your risk of developing Crohn's disease, and once you have it, smoking can make it worse. People with Crohn's disease who smoke are more likely to have relapses and need medications and repeat surgeries.</p>\n",
              "<p>Smoking may help prevent ulcerative colitis. However, its harm to overall health outweighs any benefit, and quitting smoking can improve the general health of your digestive tract, as well as provide many other health benefits.</p>\n",
              "<h3>Stress</h3><p>The association of stress with Crohn's disease is controversial, but many people who have the disease report symptom flares during high-stress periods. If you have trouble managing stress, try one of these strategies:</p>\n",

              " <p>To help confirm a diagnosis of <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr>, you will need a combination of tests and procedures:</p>,\n",
              " <h3>Lab tests</h3>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Tests for anemia or infection.</strong> Your provider may suggest blood tests to check for anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues — or to check for signs of infection from bacteria or viruses.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Stool studies.</strong> You may need to provide a stool sample so that your provider can test for hidden (occult) blood or organisms, such as parasites, in your stool.</li>,\n",
              " <h3>Endoscopic procedures</h3>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Colonoscopy.</strong> This exam allows your provider to view your entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a camera at the end. During the procedure, small samples of tissue (biopsy) may be taken for laboratory analysis. A biopsy is the way to make the diagnosis of <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> versus other forms of inflammation.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Flexible sigmoidoscopy.</strong> Your provider uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the rectum and sigmoid, the last portion of your colon. If your colon is severely inflamed, your provider may perform this test instead of a full colonoscopy.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Upper endoscopy.</strong> In this procedure, your provider uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine (duodenum). While it is rare for these areas to be involved with Crohn's disease, this test may be recommended if you are having nausea and vomiting, difficulty eating, or upper abdominal pain.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Capsule endoscopy.</strong> This test is sometimes used to help diagnose Crohn's disease involving your small intestine. You swallow a capsule that has a camera in it. The images are transmitted to a recorder you wear on your belt, after which the capsule exits your body painlessly in your stool. You may still need an endoscopy with a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Capsule endoscopy should not be performed if a bowel obstruction is suspected.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Balloon-assisted enteroscopy.</strong> For this test, a scope is used in conjunction with a device called an overtube. This enables the technician to look further into the small bowel where standard endoscopes don't reach. This technique is useful when a capsule endoscopy shows abnormalities, but the diagnosis is still in question.</li>,\n",
              " <h3>Imaging procedures</h3>,\n",
              " <li><strong>X-ray.</strong> If you have severe symptoms, your provider may use a standard X-ray of your abdominal area to rule out serious complications, such as megacolon or a perforated colon.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Computerized tomography (CT) scan.</strong> You may have a <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> scan — a special X-ray technique that provides more detail than a standard X-ray does. This test looks at the entire bowel as well as at tissues outside the bowel. <abbr title=\"Computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> enterography is a special <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> scan that provides better images of the small bowel. This test has replaced barium X-rays in most medical centers.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</strong> An <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr> scanner uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues. An <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr> is particularly useful for evaluating a fistula around the anal area (pelvic <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr>) or the small intestine (<abbr title=\"magnetic resonance\">MR</abbr> enterography). Unlike <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr>, there is no radiation exposure with <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr>.</li>,\n",
              " <h2>Treatment</h2>,\n",
              " <p>The goal of inflammatory bowel disease treatment is to reduce the inflammation that triggers your signs and symptoms. In the best cases, this may lead not only to symptom relief but also to long-term remission and reduced risks of complications. <abbr title=\"Inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> treatment usually involves either drug therapy or surgery.</p>,\n",
              " <h3>Anti-inflammatory drugs</h3>,\n",
              " <p>Anti-inflammatory drugs are often the first step in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, typically for mild to moderate disease. Anti-inflammatories include aminosalicylates, such as mesalamine (Delzicol, Rowasa, others), balsalazide (Colazal) and olsalazine (Dipentum).</p>,\n",
              " <p>Time-limited courses of corticosteroids are also used to induce remission. In addition to being anti-inflammatory, steroids are immunosuppressing. Which medication you take depends on the area of your colon that's affected.</p>,\n",
              " <h3>Immune system suppressors</h3>,\n",
              " <p>These drugs work in a variety of ways to suppress the immune response that releases inflammation-inducing chemicals into the body. When released, these chemicals can damage the lining of the digestive tract.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Some examples of immunosuppressant drugs include azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan) and methotrexate (Trexall).</p>,\n",
              " <p>More recently, orally delivered agents also known as \"small molecules\" have become available for <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> treatment. These include tofacitinib (Xeljanz), upadacitinib (Rinvoq) and ozanimod (Zeposia).</p>,\n",
              " <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued a warning about tofacitinib, stating that preliminary studies show an increased risk of serious heart-related problems and cancer from taking this drug. If you're taking tofacitinib for ulcerative colitis, don't stop taking the medication without first talking with your doctor.</p>,\n",
              " <h3>Biologics</h3>,\n",
              " <p>Biologics are a newer category of therapy in which therapy is directed toward neutralizing proteins in the body that are causing inflammation. Some are administered via intravenous (IV) infusions and others are injections you give yourself. Examples include infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), golimumab (Simponi), certolizumab (Cimzia), vedolizumab (Entyvio), ustekinumab (Stelara), and risankizumab (Skyrizi).</p>,\n",
              " <h3>Antibiotics</h3>,\n",
              " <p>Antibiotics may be used in addition to other medications or when infection is a concern — in cases of perianal Crohn's disease, for example. Frequently prescribed antibiotics include ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and metronidazole (Flagyl).</p>,\n",
              " <h3>Other medications and supplements</h3>,\n",
              " <p>In addition to controlling inflammation, some medications may help relieve your signs and symptoms, but always talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medications. Depending on the severity of your <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr>, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following:</p>,\n",
              " <li>\n",
              " <p><strong>Anti-diarrheal medications.</strong> A fiber supplement — such as psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) — can help relieve mild to moderate diarrhea by adding bulk to your stool. For more severe diarrhea, loperamide (Imodium A-D) may be effective.</p>\n",

However, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and diclofenac sodium likely will make your symptoms worse and can make your disease worse as well.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Vitamins and supplements.</strong> If you're not absorbing enough nutrients, your doctor may recommend vitamins and nutritional supplements.</li>,\n",
              " <h3>Nutritional support</h3>,\n",
              " <p>When weight loss is severe, your doctor may recommend a special diet given via a feeding tube (enteral nutrition) or nutrients injected into a vein (parenteral nutrition) to treat your <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr>. This can improve your overall nutrition and allow the bowel to rest. Bowel rest can reduce inflammation in the short term.</p>,\n",
              " <p>If you have a stenosis or stricture in the bowel, your doctor may recommend a low-residue diet. This will help to minimize the chance that undigested food will get stuck in the narrowed part of the bowel and lead to a blockage.</p>,\n",

              " <p>Here are some general dietary suggestions that may help you manage your condition:</p>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Limit dairy products.</strong> Many people with inflammatory bowel disease find that problems such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and gas improve by limiting or eliminating dairy products. You may be lactose intolerant — that is, your body can't digest the milk sugar (lactose) in dairy foods. Using an enzyme product such as Lactaid may help as well.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Eat small meals.</strong> You may find that you feel better eating five or six small meals a day rather than two or three larger ones.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Drink plenty of liquids.</strong> Try to drink plenty of liquids daily. Water is best. Alcohol and beverages that contain caffeine stimulate your intestines and can make diarrhea worse, while carbonated drinks frequently produce gas.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Consider multivitamins.</strong> Because Crohn's disease can interfere with your ability to absorb nutrients and because your diet may be limited, multivitamin and mineral supplements are often helpful. Check with your doctor before taking any vitamins or supplements.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Talk to a dietitian.</strong> If you begin to lose weight or your diet has become very limited, talk to a registered dietitian.</li>,\n",
              " <h3>Smoking</h3>,\n",
              " <p>Smoking increases your risk of developing Crohn's disease, and once you have it, smoking can make it worse. People with Crohn's disease who smoke are more likely to have relapses and need medications and repeat surgeries.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Smoking may help prevent ulcerative colitis. However, its harm to overall health outweighs any benefit, and quitting smoking can improve the general health of your digestive tract, as well as provide many other health benefits.</p>,\n",
              " <h3>Stress</h3>,\n",
              " <p>The association of stress with Crohn's disease is controversial, but many people who have the disease report symptom flares during high-stress periods. If you have trouble managing stress, try one of these strategies:</p>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Exercise.</strong> Even mild exercise can help reduce stress, relieve depression and normalize bowel function. Talk to your doctor about an exercise plan that's right for you.</li>,\n",

            "<p>To help confirm a diagnosis of <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr>, you will need a combination of tests and procedures:</p>\n",
            "<h3>Lab tests</h3>\n",
            "<li><strong>Tests for anemia or infection.</strong> Your provider may suggest blood tests to check for anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues — or to check for signs of infection from bacteria or viruses.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Stool studies.</strong> You may need to provide a stool sample so that your provider can test for hidden (occult) blood or organisms, such as parasites, in your stool.</li>\n",
            "<h3>Endoscopic procedures</h3>\n",
            "<li><strong>Colonoscopy.</strong> This exam allows your provider to view your entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a camera at the end. During the procedure, small samples of tissue (biopsy) may be taken for laboratory analysis. A biopsy is the way to make the diagnosis of <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> versus other forms of inflammation.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Flexible sigmoidoscopy.</strong> Your provider uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the rectum and sigmoid, the last portion of your colon. If your colon is severely inflamed, your provider may perform this test instead of a full colonoscopy.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Upper endoscopy.</strong> In this procedure, your provider uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine (duodenum). While it is rare for these areas to be involved with Crohn's disease, this test may be recommended if you are having nausea and vomiting, difficulty eating, or upper abdominal pain.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Capsule endoscopy.</strong> This test is sometimes used to help diagnose Crohn's disease involving your small intestine. You swallow a capsule that has a camera in it. The images are transmitted to a recorder you wear on your belt, after which the capsule exits your body painlessly in your stool. You may still need an endoscopy with a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Capsule endoscopy should not be performed if a bowel obstruction is suspected.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Balloon-assisted enteroscopy.</strong> For this test, a scope is used in conjunction with a device called an overtube. This enables the technician to look further into the small bowel where standard endoscopes don't reach. This technique is useful when a capsule endoscopy shows abnormalities, but the diagnosis is still in question.</li>\n",
            "<h3>Imaging procedures</h3>\n",
            "<li><strong>X-ray.</strong> If you have severe symptoms, your provider may use a standard X-ray of your abdominal area to rule out serious complications, such as megacolon or a perforated colon.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Computerized tomography (CT) scan.</strong> You may have a <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> scan — a special X-ray technique that provides more detail than a standard X-ray does. This test looks at the entire bowel as well as at tissues outside the bowel. <abbr title=\"Computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> enterography is a special <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr> scan that provides better images of the small bowel. This test has replaced barium X-rays in most medical centers.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</strong> An <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr> scanner uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues. An <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr> is particularly useful for evaluating a fistula around the anal area (pelvic <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr>) or the small intestine (<abbr title=\"magnetic resonance\">MR</abbr> enterography). Unlike <abbr title=\"computerized tomography\">CT</abbr>, there is no radiation exposure with <abbr title=\"magnetic resonance imaging\">MRI</abbr>.</li>\n",
            "<h2>Treatment</h2>\n",
            "<p>The goal of inflammatory bowel disease treatment is to reduce the inflammation that triggers your signs and symptoms. In the best cases, this may lead not only to symptom relief but also to long-term remission and reduced risks of complications. <abbr title=\"Inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> treatment usually involves either drug therapy or surgery.</p>\n",
            "<h3>Anti-inflammatory drugs</h3>\n",
            "<p>Anti-inflammatory drugs are often the first step in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, typically for mild to moderate disease. Anti-inflammatories include aminosalicylates, such as mesalamine (Delzicol, Rowasa, others), balsalazide (Colazal) and olsalazine (Dipentum).</p>\n",
            "<p>Time-limited courses of corticosteroids are also used to induce remission. In addition to being anti-inflammatory, steroids are immunosuppressing. Which medication you take depends on the area of your colon that's affected.</p>\n",
            "<h3>Immune system suppressors</h3>\n",
            "<p>These drugs work in a variety of ways to suppress the immune response that releases inflammation-inducing chemicals into the body. When released, these chemicals can damage the lining of the digestive tract.</p>\n",
            "<p>Some examples of immunosuppressant drugs include azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan) and methotrexate (Trexall).</p>\n",
            "<p>More recently, orally delivered agents also known as \"small molecules\" have become available for <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> treatment. These include tofacitinib (Xeljanz), upadacitinib (Rinvoq) and ozanimod (Zeposia).</p>\n",
            "<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued a warning about tofacitinib, stating that preliminary studies show an increased risk of serious heart-related problems and cancer from taking this drug. If you're taking tofacitinib for ulcerative colitis, don't stop taking the medication without first talking with your doctor.</p>\n",
            "<h3>Biologics</h3>\n",
            "<p>Biologics are a newer category of therapy in which therapy is directed toward neutralizing proteins in the body that are causing inflammation. Some are administered via intravenous (IV) infusions and others are injections you give yourself. Examples include infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), golimumab (Simponi), certolizumab (Cimzia), vedolizumab (Entyvio), ustekinumab (Stelara), and risankizumab (Skyrizi).</p>\n",
            "<h3>Antibiotics</h3>\n",
            "<p>Antibiotics may be used in addition to other medications or when infection is a concern — in cases of perianal Crohn's disease, for example. Frequently prescribed antibiotics include ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and metronidazole (Flagyl).</p>\n",
            "<h3>Other medications and supplements</h3>\n",
            "<p>In addition to controlling inflammation, some medications may help relieve your signs and symptoms, but always talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medications. Depending on the severity of your <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr>, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following:</p>\n",
            "<li>\n",
            "<p><strong>Anti-diarrheal medications.</strong> A fiber supplement — such as psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) — can help relieve mild to moderate diarrhea by adding bulk to your stool. For more severe diarrhea, loperamide (Imodium A-D) may be effective.</p>\n",
            "<p>These medications could be ineffective or detrimental in some people with strictures or certain infections. Please consult your doctor before taking these medications.</p>\n",

However, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and diclofenac sodium likely will make your symptoms worse and can make your disease worse as well.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Vitamins and supplements.</strong> If you're not absorbing enough nutrients, your doctor may recommend vitamins and nutritional supplements.</li>\n",
            "<h3>Nutritional support</h3>\n",
            "<p>When weight loss is severe, your doctor may recommend a special diet given via a feeding tube (enteral nutrition) or nutrients injected into a vein (parenteral nutrition) to treat your <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr>. This can improve your overall nutrition and allow the bowel to rest. Bowel rest can reduce inflammation in the short term.</p>\n",
            "<p>If you have a stenosis or stricture in the bowel, your doctor may recommend a low-residue diet. This will help to minimize the chance that undigested food will get stuck in the narrowed part of the bowel and lead to a blockage.</p>\n",
            "<h3>Surgery</h3>\n",
            "<p>If diet and lifestyle changes, drug therapy, or other treatments don't relieve your <abbr title=\"inflammatory bowel disease\">IBD</abbr> signs and symptoms, your provider may recommend surgery.</p>\n",
            "<li>\n",
            "<p><strong>Surgery for ulcerative colitis.</strong> Surgery involves removal of the entire colon and rectum and the production of an internal pouch attached to the anus that allows bowel movements without a bag.</p>\n",

            "<p>Sometimes you may feel helpless when facing inflammatory bowel disease. But changes in your diet and lifestyle may help control your symptoms and lengthen the time between flare-ups.</p>\n",
            "<h3>Diet</h3>\n",
            "<p>There's no firm evidence that what you eat actually causes inflammatory bowel disease. But certain foods and beverages can aggravate your signs and symptoms, especially during a flare-up.</p>\n",
            "<p>It can be helpful to keep a food diary to keep track of what you're eating, as well as how you feel. If you discover that some foods are causing your symptoms to flare, you can try eliminating those foods.</p>\n",
            "<p>Here are some general dietary suggestions that may help you manage your condition:</p>\n",
            "<li><strong>Limit dairy products.</strong> Many people with inflammatory bowel disease find that problems such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and gas improve by limiting or eliminating dairy products. You may be lactose intolerant — that is, your body can't digest the milk sugar (lactose) in dairy foods. Using an enzyme product such as Lactaid may help as well.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Eat small meals.</strong> You may find that you feel better eating five or six small meals a day rather than two or three larger ones.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Drink plenty of liquids.</strong> Try to drink plenty of liquids daily. Water is best. Alcohol and beverages that contain caffeine stimulate your intestines and can make diarrhea worse, while carbonated drinks frequently produce gas.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Consider multivitamins.</strong> Because Crohn's disease can interfere with your ability to absorb nutrients and because your diet may be limited, multivitamin and mineral supplements are often helpful. Check with your doctor before taking any vitamins or supplements.</li>\n",
            "<li><strong>Talk to a dietitian.</strong> If you begin to lose weight or your diet has become very limited, talk to a registered dietitian.</li>\n",
            "<h3>Smoking</h3>\n",
            "<p>Smoking increases your risk of developing Crohn's disease, and once you have it, smoking can make it worse. People with Crohn's disease who smoke are more likely to have relapses and need medications and repeat surgeries.</p>\n",
            "<p>Smoking may help prevent ulcerative colitis. However, its harm to overall health outweighs any benefit, and quitting smoking can improve the general health of your digestive tract, as well as provide many other health benefits.</p>\n",
            "<h3>Stress</h3>\n",
            "<p>The association of stress with Crohn's disease is controversial, but many people who have the disease report symptom flares during high-stress periods. If you have trouble managing stress, try one of these strategies:</p>\n",
            "<li><strong>Exercise.</strong> Even mild exercise can help reduce stress, relieve depression and normalize bowel function. Talk to your doctor about an exercise plan that's right for you.</li>\n",

Issues with labor progression include prolonged first stage (prolonged dilation or opening of the cervix) or prolonged second stage (prolonged time of pushing after complete cervical dilation).\n",
            " 2. The baby is in distress. Concern about changes in a baby's heartbeat might make a C-section the safest option.\n",
            " 3. The baby or babies are in an unusual position. A C-section is the safest way to deliver babies whose feet or buttocks enter the birth canal first (breech) or babies whose sides or shoulders come first (transverse).\n",
            " 4. You're carrying more than one baby. A C-section might be needed for women carrying twins, triplets or more. This is especially true if labor starts too early or the babies are not in a head-down position.\n",
            " 5. There's a problem with the placenta. If the placenta covers the opening of the cervix (placenta previa), a C-section is recommended for delivery.\n",
            " 6. Prolapsed umbilical cord. A C-section might be recommended if a loop of umbilical cord slips through the cervix in front of the baby.\n",
            " 7. There's a health concern. A C-section might be recommended for women with certain health issues, such as a heart or brain condition.\n",
            " 8. There's a blockage. A large fibroid blocking the birth canal, a pelvic fracture or a baby who has a condition that can cause the head to be unusually large (severe hydrocephalus) might be reasons for a C-section.\n",
            " 9. You've had a previous C-section or other surgery on the uterus. Although it's often possible to have a vaginal birth after a C-section, a health care provider might recommend a repeat C-section.\n",
            "Some women request C-sections with their first babies. They might want to avoid labor or the possible complications of vaginal birth. Or they might want to plan the time of delivery. However, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, this might not be a good option for women who plan to have several children. The more C-sections a woman has, the greater the risk of problems with future pregnancies.\n",

            "Risks to mothers include:\n",
            " 1. Infection. After a C-section, there might be a risk of developing an infection of the lining of the uterus (endometritis), in the urinary tract or at the site of the incision.\n",
            " 2. Blood loss. A C-section might cause heavy bleeding during and after delivery.\n",
            " 3. Reactions to anesthesia. Reactions to any type of anesthesia are possible.\n",
            " 4. Blood clots. A C-section might increase the risk of developing a blood clot inside a deep vein, especially in the legs or pelvis (deep vein thrombosis). If a blood clot travels to the lungs and blocks blood flow (pulmonary embolism), the damage can be life-threatening.\n",
            " 5. Surgical injury. Although rare, surgical injuries to the bladder or bowel can occur during a C-section.\n",
            " 6. Increased risks during future pregnancies. Having a C-section increases the risk of complications in a later pregnancy and in other surgeries. The more C-sections, the higher the risks of placenta previa and a condition in which the placenta becomes attached to the wall of the uterus (placenta accreta).\n",

            " 1. At home. Your health care provider might ask you to shower at home with an antiseptic soap the night before and the morning of your C-section. Don't shave your pubic hair within 24 hours of your C-section. This can increase the risk of a surgical site infection. If your pubic hair needs to be removed, it will be trimmed by the surgical staff just before surgery.\n",
            " 2. At the hospital. Your abdomen will be cleansed. A thin tube (catheter) will likely be placed into your bladder to collect urine. An intravenous line will be placed in a vein in your hand or arm to provide fluid and drugs, including antibiotics to prevent infection.\n",
            " 3. Anesthesia. Most C-sections are done under regional anesthesia, which numbs only the lower part of your body. This allows you to be awake during the procedure. Common choices include a spinal block and an epidural block.\n",
            "Some C-sections might require general anesthesia. With general anesthesia, you won't be awake during the birth.\n",

            "A doctor makes surgical incisions in the abdomen and the uterus to deliver the baby.\n",
            " 1. Abdominal incision. The doctor makes an incision in the abdominal wall. It's usually done horizontally near the pubic hairline. Or the doctor might make a vertical incision from just below the navel to just above the pubic bone.\n",
            " 2. Uterine incision. The uterine incision is then made — usually horizontally across the lower part of the uterus (low transverse incision). Other types of uterine incisions might be used depending on the baby's position within the uterus and whether there are complications, such as placenta previa or preterm delivery.\n",
            " 3. Delivery. The baby will be delivered through the incisions. The doctor clears the baby's mouth and nose of fluids, then clamps and cuts the umbilical cord. The placenta is then removed from the uterus, and the incisions are closed with sutures.\n",
            "If you have regional anesthesia, you're likely to be able to hold the baby shortly after delivery.\n",
            "After the procedure:\n",
            "A C-section usually requires a hospital stay for 2 to 3 days. Your health care provider will discuss pain relief options with you.\n",
            "Once the anesthesia begins to wear off, you'll be encouraged to drink fluids and walk. This helps prevent constipation and deep vein thrombosis. Your health care team will monitor your incision for signs of infection. The bladder catheter will likely be removed as soon as possible.\n",
            "You can start breastfeeding as soon as you're ready, even in the delivery room. Ask your nurse or a lactation consultant to teach you how to position yourself and support your baby so that you're comfortable. Your health care team will select medications for your post-surgical pain with breastfeeding in mind.\n",
            "When you go home:\n",
            "During the C-section recovery process, discomfort and fatigue are common. To promote healing:\n",
            " 1. Take it easy. Rest when possible. Try to keep everything that you and your baby need within reach. For the first few weeks, don't lift more than 25 pounds.\n",
            " 2. Use recommended pain relief. To soothe incision soreness, your health care provider might recommend a heating pad and pain medications that are safe for breastfeeding women and their babies. These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).\n",
            " 3. Wait to have sex. To prevent infection, wait at least six weeks to have sex and don't put anything in your vagina after your C-section.\n",
            " 4. Wait to drive. If you're taking narcotics for pain relief, it might take 1 to 2 weeks before you can comfortably apply brakes and twist to check blind spots.\n",
            "Check your C-section incision for signs of infection. Pay attention to any symptoms. Contact your health care provider if:\n",
            " 1. Your incision is red, swollen or leaking discharge\n",
            " 2. You have a fever\n",
            " 3. You have heavy bleeding\n",
            " 4. You have worsening pain\n",
            "If you have severe mood swings, loss of appetite, overwhelming fatigue and lack of joy in life shortly after childbirth, you might have postpartum depression. Contact your health care provider if you think you might be depressed, especially if your symptoms don't go away, you have trouble caring for your baby or completing daily tasks, or you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.\n",
            "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that postpartum care be ongoing. Have contact with your health care provider within three weeks after delivery. Within 12 weeks after delivery, see your health care provider for a postpartum evaluation.\n",
            "During this appointment your health care provider likely will check your mood and emotional well-being, discuss contraception and birth spacing, review information about infant care and feeding, talk about your sleep habits and issues related to fatigue and do a physical exam, including a pap smear if it's due. This might include a check of your abdomen, vagina, cervix and uterus to make sure you're healing well.\n",

            "For most men, erectile dysfunction can be successfully treated with medications or use of a penis pump (vacuum constriction device). You might consider penile implants if you aren't a candidate for other treatments or you can't get an erection sufficient for sexual activity by using other methods.\n",
            "Penile implants can also be used to treat severe cases of a condition that causes scarring inside the penis, leading to curved, painful erections (Peyronie's disease).\n",

            "  > An infection, such as a pulmonary infection or urinary tract infection\n",
            "  > Diabetes that isn't well controlled or significant heart disease\n",
            "While penile implants allow men to get an erection, they don't increase sexual desire or sensation. Penile implants also won't make your penis any larger than it is at the time of surgery. In fact, with an implant, your erect penis might seem slightly shorter than it used to be.\n",

            "  > Implant problems. New penile implant designs are reliable, but in rare cases the implants malfunction. Surgery is necessary to repair or replace a broken implant, but a broken device can be left in place if you don't want another surgery.\n",
            "  > Internal erosion or adhesion. In some cases, an implant might stick to the skin inside the penis or wear away the skin from inside the penis. Rarely, an implant breaks through the skin. These problems are sometimes linked to an infection.\n",

            "Other special designs can fit a shortened penis or one that's larger than average. Inflatable penile implants are also available with antibiotic coatings, which might help reduce the risk of infection, and coatings to reduce friction, possibly lengthening the life of the implant.\n",
            "Comparing implant types:\n",
            "When choosing a type of penile implant, consider your personal preference and your medical history. Your health care provider might suggest one type of design over another based on your age, risk of infection, and health conditions, injuries or medical treatments you've had.\n",

            "Your health care provider will give you IV antibiotics to help prevent infection. The surgery site will also be washed with an alcohol-based antibiotic solution and shaved before surgery to reduce the risk of infection.\n",
            "During surgery:\n",
            "A tube (catheter) might be inserted into your bladder via your penis to collect urine at some point during surgery. Your surgeon will make an incision below the head of the penis, at the base of the penis or in the lower abdomen.\n",
            "Next, your surgeon will stretch the spongy tissue in the penis that would normally fill with blood during an erection. This tissue is inside each of two hollow chambers called the corpora cavernosa.\n",
            "Your surgeon will choose the correct size implant and place the implant cylinders inside your penis. All sizes are customized to your body measurements.\n",
            "If your surgeon is implanting a two-piece inflatable device, a pump and valve are placed inside the scrotum. For a three-piece device, he or she will also implant a fluid reservoir above or under the abdominal wall using the initial incision. Sometimes a second incision in the abdomen in used.\n",
            "Once the device is in place, your surgeon will sew the incisions closed. Penile implant surgery usually takes 45 minutes to an hour.\n",
            "After surgery:\n",
            "After penile implant surgery, you'll likely need to take medications to ease pain. Often a long-acting injection is given into the scrotum to help reduce pain for 48 to 72 hours. Mild pain might persist for several weeks. You might be given an antibiotic to be taken by mouth for a week.\n",
            "Ask your health care provider when you can resume your regular activities. Most men can resume strenuous physical activity and sexual activity about 4 to 6 weeks after surgery.\n",
            "After you learn how to use the device, usually 3 to 6 weeks after surgery, your health care provider might recommend inflating and deflating inflatable penile implants to give you practice using them and stretch the area surrounding the cylinders.\n",

              " <p>Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a type of radiation therapy that uses many beams of energy. The beams are carefully targeted to focus on growths of cells, which are called tumors, anywhere in the body.</p>,\n",
              " <p><abbr title=\"Stereotactic body radiotherapy\">SBRT</abbr> is used to treat tumors in the lungs, spine, liver, neck, lymph nodes or other soft tissues.</p>,\n",
              " <p><abbr title=\"Stereotactic body radiotherapy\">SBRT</abbr> is sometimes called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). When used on the brain, it is often called stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).</p>,\n",
              " <p><abbr title=\"Stereotactic body radiotherapy\">SBRT</abbr> uses 3D or 4D imaging and highly focused radiation beams to send high doses of radiation to the area to be treated. This results in the least amount of damage to the healthy tissues around the area.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Like other forms of radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy works by hurting the DNA inside the tumor cells. The damage from the radiation stops the cells from making more tumor cells. This causes tumors to shrink.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Stereotactic body radiotherapy usually takes 1 to 5 sessions.</p>,\n",
              " <h4>Types of stereotactic body radiotherapy</h4>,\n",
              " <p>Types of <abbr title=\"stereotactic body radiotherapy\">SBRT</abbr> include:</p>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Linear accelerator, also known as LINAC.</strong> <abbr title=\"Linear accelerator\">LINAC</abbr> machines use X-rays, also known as photons, to treat tumors.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Proton beam, also called charged particle.</strong> This newer type of stereotactic radiotherapy uses protons to treat tumors over several sessions. Proton beam radiotherapy might be used to treat tumors in parts of the body that have already had radiation therapy. Or they can treat tumors that are near vital organs.</li>,\n",
              " <h3>Why it's done</h3>,\n",
              " <p>Stereotactic body radiotherapy is used to treat growths of cells, which are called tumors. <abbr title=\"Stereotactic body radiotherapy\">SBRT</abbr> is used to treat tumors in the lungs, spine, liver, neck, lymph nodes, soft tissues and other parts of the body. <abbr title=\"Stereotactic body radiotherapy\">SBRT</abbr> is used to treat cancerous tumors and tumors that aren't cancerous, which are called benign tumors.</p>,\n",

              " <li><strong>Swelling.</strong> Swelling at or near the treatment site can cause symptoms such as a short-term increase in pain. A health care provider might prescribe medicines to prevent or treat these symptoms.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Nausea or vomiting.</strong> Treatment for a tumor near the bowel or liver might cause these symptoms for a short time.</li>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Skin changes.</strong> Skin in the treatment area can become irritated, itchy or dry.</li>,\n",
              " <p><strong>Late side effects</strong></p>,\n",
              " <p>Rarely, some people get side effects months or even years after treatment. These might include:</p>,\n",
              " <li>Weakened bones that can break.</li>,\n",
              " <li>Changes in the bowel or bladder.</li>,\n",

              " <h4>Food and medications</h4>,\n",
              " <li>You might be asked not to eat or drink anything 2 to 3 hours before the procedure.</li>,\n",

              " <h4>Clothing and personal items</h4>,\n",
              " <p>Wear comfortable, loose clothing.</p>,\n",

              " <h4>Medical devices</h4>,\n",
              " <p>Tell your health care team if you have medical devices inside your body. These might include a pacemaker, artificial heart valve, aneurysm clips, neurostimulators or stents.</p>,\n",
              " <h3>What you can expect</h3>,\n",
              " <p>Stereotactic body radiotherapy is usually an outpatient procedure. This means you likely won't need to stay in the hospital after treatment.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Each treatment takes up to an hour. It's usually not necessary to have a family member or friend come with you to treatment. Ask a member of your health care team if you'll need to have someone with you.</p>,\n",
              " <p>All types of stereotactic body radiotherapy work in a similar way. The machine focuses beams of radiation on the target. Each beam does little damage to the tissues it passes through. The spot where all the beams meet gets a high dose of radiation.</p>,\n",
              " <p>The high dose of radiation causes tumors to shrink. Over time, the radiation causes blood vessels to close, robbing tumors of their blood supply.</p>,\n",
              " <h4>Before the procedure</h4>,\n",
              " <p>Your health care team takes several steps before stereotactic body radiotherapy. Steps might include:</p>,\n",
              " <li><strong>Positioning.</strong> To target treatment exactly, the person getting treated must remain completely still. Your health care team will find the best position for your body. Often this involves using custom devices to hold you in place and keep you comfortable.</li>,\n",

Issues with labor progression include prolonged first stage (prolonged dilation or opening of the cervix) or prolonged second stage (prolonged time of pushing after complete cervical dilation).\n",
            " 2. The baby is in distress. Concern about changes in a baby's heartbeat might make a C-section the safest option.\n",
            " 3. The baby or babies are in an unusual position. A C-section is the safest way to deliver babies whose feet or buttocks enter the birth canal first (breech) or babies whose sides or shoulders come first (transverse).\n",
            " 4. You're carrying more than one baby. A C-section might be needed for women carrying twins, triplets or more. This is especially true if labor starts too early or the babies are not in a head-down position.\n",
            " 5. There's a problem with the placenta. If the placenta covers the opening of the cervix (placenta previa), a C-section is recommended for delivery.\n",

            " 7. There's a health concern. A C-section might be recommended for women with certain health issues, such as a heart or brain condition.\n",
            " 8. There's a blockage. A large fibroid blocking the birth canal, a pelvic fracture or a baby who has a condition that can cause the head to be unusually large (severe hydrocephalus) might be reasons for a C-section.\n",

However, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, this might not be a good option for women who plan to have several children.

            " 2. Blood loss. A C-section might cause heavy bleeding during and after delivery.\n",
            " 3. Reactions to anesthesia. Reactions to any type of anesthesia are possible.\n",
            " 4. Blood clots. A C-section might increase the risk of developing a blood clot inside a deep vein, especially in the legs or pelvis (deep vein thrombosis). If a blood clot travels to the lungs and blocks blood flow (pulmonary embolism), the damage can be life-threatening.\n",
            " 5. Surgical injury. Although rare, surgical injuries to the bladder or bowel can occur during a C-section.\n",
            " 6. Increased risks during future pregnancies. Having a C-section increases the risk of complications in a later pregnancy and in other surgeries. The more C-sections, the higher the risks of placenta previa and a condition in which the placenta becomes attached to the wall of the uterus (placenta accreta).\n",

            " 1. At home. Your health care provider might ask you to shower at home with an antiseptic soap the night before and the morning of your C-section. Don't shave your pubic hair within 24 hours of your C-section. This can increase the risk of a surgical site infection. If your pubic hair needs to be removed, it will be trimmed by the surgical staff just before surgery.\n",
            " 2. At the hospital. Your abdomen will be cleansed. A thin tube (catheter) will likely be placed into your bladder to collect urine. An intravenous line will be placed in a vein in your hand or arm to provide fluid and drugs, including antibiotics to prevent infection.\n",
            " 3. Anesthesia. Most C-sections are done under regional anesthesia, which numbs only the lower part of your body. This allows you to be awake during the procedure. Common choices include a spinal block and an epidural block.\n",
            "Some C-sections might require general anesthesia. With general anesthesia, you won't be awake during the birth.\n",

            "A doctor makes surgical incisions in the abdomen and the uterus to deliver the baby.\n",
            " 1. Abdominal incision. The doctor makes an incision in the abdominal wall. It's usually done horizontally near the pubic hairline. Or the doctor might make a vertical incision from just below the navel to just above the pubic bone.\n",
            " 2. Uterine incision. The uterine incision is then made — usually horizontally across the lower part of the uterus (low transverse incision). Other types of uterine incisions might be used depending on the baby's position within the uterus and whether there are complications, such as placenta previa or preterm delivery.\n",
            " 3. Delivery. The baby will be delivered through the incisions. The doctor clears the baby's mouth and nose of fluids, then clamps and cuts the umbilical cord. The placenta is then removed from the uterus, and the incisions are closed with sutures.\n",
            "If you have regional anesthesia, you're likely to be able to hold the baby shortly after delivery.\n",
            "After the procedure:\n",
            "A C-section usually requires a hospital stay for 2 to 3 days. Your health care provider will discuss pain relief options with you.\n",
            "Once the anesthesia begins to wear off, you'll be encouraged to drink fluids and walk. This helps prevent constipation and deep vein thrombosis. Your health care team will monitor your incision for signs of infection. The bladder catheter will likely be removed as soon as possible.\n",
            "You can start breastfeeding as soon as you're ready, even in the delivery room. Ask your nurse or a lactation consultant to teach you how to position yourself and support your baby so that you're comfortable. Your health care team will select medications for your post-surgical pain with breastfeeding in mind.\n",
            "When you go home:\n",
            "During the C-section recovery process, discomfort and fatigue are common. To promote healing:\n",
            " 1. Take it easy. Rest when possible. Try to keep everything that you and your baby need within reach. For the first few weeks, don't lift more than 25 pounds.\n",
            " 2. Use recommended pain relief. To soothe incision soreness, your health care provider might recommend a heating pad and pain medications that are safe for breastfeeding women and their babies. These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).\n",
            " 3. Wait to have sex. To prevent infection, wait at least six weeks to have sex and don't put anything in your vagina after your C-section.\n",
            " 4. Wait to drive. If you're taking narcotics for pain relief, it might take 1 to 2 weeks before you can comfortably apply brakes and twist to check blind spots.\n",
            "Check your C-section incision for signs of infection. Pay attention to any symptoms. Contact your health care provider if:\n",
            " 1. Your incision is red, swollen or leaking discharge\n",
            " 2. You have a fever\n",
            " 3. You have heavy bleeding\n",
            " 4. You have worsening pain\n",
            "If you have severe mood swings, loss of appetite, overwhelming fatigue and lack of joy in life shortly after childbirth, you might have postpartum depression. Contact your health care provider if you think you might be depressed, especially if your symptoms don't go away, you have trouble caring for your baby or completing daily tasks, or you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.\n",
            "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that postpartum care be ongoing. Have contact with your health care provider within three weeks after delivery. Within 12 weeks after delivery, see your health care provider for a postpartum evaluation.\n",
            "During this appointment your health care provider likely will check your mood and emotional well-being, discuss contraception and birth spacing, review information about infant care and feeding, talk about your sleep habits and issues related to fatigue and do a physical exam, including a pap smear if it's due. This might include a check of your abdomen, vagina, cervix and uterus to make sure you're healing well.\n",

            "As ankylosing spondylitis worsens, new bone forms as part of the body's attempt to heal. The new bone gradually bridges the gaps between vertebrae and eventually fuses sections of vertebrae together. Fused vertebrae can flatten the natural curves of the spine, which causes an inflexible, hunched posture.\n",
            "Axial spondyloarthritis has two types. When the condition is found on X-ray, it is called ankylosing spondylitis, also known as axial spondyloarthritis. When the condition can't be seen on X-ray but is found based on symptoms, blood tests and other imaging tests, it is called nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis.\n",
            "Symptoms typically begin in early adulthood. Inflammation also can occur in other parts of the body — most commonly, the eyes.\n",
            "There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis, but treatments can lessen symptoms and possibly slow progression of the disease.\n",

            "  > The joint between the base of the spine and the pelvis.\n",
            "  > The vertebrae in the lower back.\n",
            "  > The places where tendons and ligaments attach to bones, mainly in the spine, but sometimes along the back of the heel.\n",

Fusion also can stiffen the rib cage, restricting lung capacity and function.\n",

            "  > Eye inflammation, called uveitis. One of the most common complications of ankylosing spondylitis, uveitis can cause rapid-onset eye pain, sensitivity to light and blurred vision. See your health care provider right away if you develop these symptoms.\n",
            "  > Compression fractures. Some people's bones weaken during the early stages of ankylosing spondylitis. Weakened vertebrae can crumple, increasing the severity of a stooped posture. Vertebral fractures can put pressure on and possibly injure the spinal cord and the nerves that pass through the spine.\n",
            "  > Heart problems. Ankylosing spondylitis can cause problems with the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The inflamed aorta can enlarge to the point that it distorts the shape of the aortic valve in the heart, which impairs its function.

              "[\"Overview</header>\\n\\nAtrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.\\nDuring atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people, AFib may have no symptoms. But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness.\\nEpisodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke.\\nTreatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals.\\nA person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.\",\n",
              " \"Symptoms</header>\\n\\nSymptoms of AFib may include:\\n  > Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.\\n  > Chest pain.\\n  > Dizziness.\\n  > Fatigue.\\n  > Lightheadedness.\\n  > Reduced ability to exercise.\\n  > Shortness of breath.\\n  > Weakness.\\nSome people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms.\\nAtrial fibrillation may be:\\n  > Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. AFib symptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasional AFib need treatment.\\n  > Persistent. The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm.\\n  > Long-standing persistent. This type of AFib is constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat.\\n  > Permanent. In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.\\nWhen to see a doctor:\\nIf you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.\\nIf you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help. Chest pain could mean that you're having a heart attack.\",\n",
              " \"Causes</header>\\n\\nTo understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats.\\nThe heart has four chambers:\\n  > The two upper chambers are called the atria.\\n  > The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.\\nInside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat.\\nThe signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers.\\nIn a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute.\\nBut in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. The AV node is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.\\nIn people with AFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute.\\nCauses of atrial fibrillation:\\nProblems with the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation (AFib).\\nHeart diseases and health problems that can cause AFib include:\\n  > A heart problem you're born with, called a congenital heart defect.\\n  > A problem with the heart's natural pacemaker, called sick sinus syndrome.\\n  > A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea.\\n  > Heart attack.\\n  > Heart valve disease.\\n  > High blood pressure.\\n  > Lung diseases, including pneumonia.\\n  > Narrowed or blocked arteries, called coronary artery disease.\\n  > Thyroid disease such as an overactive thyroid.\\n  > Infections from viruses.\\nHeart surgery or stress due to surgery or sickness may also cause AFib. Some people who have atrial fibrillation have no known heart disease or heart damage.\\nLifestyle habits that can trigger an AFib episode may include:\\n  > Drinking too much alcohol or caffeine.\\n  > Illegal drug use.\\n  > Smoking or using tobacco.\\n  > Taking medicines that contain stimulants, including cold and allergy medicines bought without a prescription.\",\n",
              " 'Risk factors</header>\\n\\nThings that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include:\\n  > Age. The risk of AFib increases as you grow older.\\n  > Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use. Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias.\\n  > Drinking too much alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.\\n  > Changes in the level of body minerals. Minerals in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur.\\n  > Family history. An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families.\\n  > Heart problems or heart surgery. Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk of AFib. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition.\\n  > High blood pressure. Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart.\\n  > Obesity. People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\\n  > Other long-term health conditions. You may be more likely to get AFib if you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea.\\n  > Some medicines and supplements. Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats.\\n  > Thyroid disease. Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats.',\n",
              " 'Complications</header>\\n\\nBlood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Blood clots can lead to stroke.\\nThe risk of stroke from AFib increases as you grow older. Other health conditions also may increase the risk of a stroke due to AFib. These conditions include:\\n  > High blood pressure.\\n  > Diabetes.\\n  > Heart failure.\\n  > Some types of heart valve disease.\\nBlood thinners are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots and strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.',\n",
              " \"Prevention</header>\\n\\nHealthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation (AFib). Here are some basic heart-healthy tips:\\n  > Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.\\n  > Don't smoke or use tobacco.\\n  > Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.\\n  > Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week unless your health care team says not to.\\n  > Get good sleep. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily.\\n  > Maintain a healthy weight.\\n  > Reduce and manage stress.\"]"
